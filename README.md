# SoundCloud-Bot
This application is made for both Windows and MacOSX systems.

Requirements:

Python 3, Selenium, and Firefox Web Browser

If you are on Windows you will need to download the geckodriver and place it in the same directory as the script.

How to use:
1. Enter the link to your song (not playlist, must be direct link to the song itself) in the songs.csv
2. Start the python script
3. Enter the amount you wish to repeat the entire list ( a custom value can be entered, must be numerical)
4. Select Start and let the script run

Please reach out and report any bugs that you encounter, I have personally tested this and confirmed over 500+ views on 19 songs tested.
