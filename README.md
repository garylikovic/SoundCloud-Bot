# SoundCloud-Bot
- Current App Version: 2.5
- This application is made for both Windows and MacOSX systems.

- Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Selenium
3. Firefox Web Browser

- Instructions:
1. Download the SoundCloud Bot.py and songs.csv, place them both in the same directory (location will not matter, just needs to be together.)

  Note: If you are on Windows you will need to download the geckodriver.exe and place it in the same directory as the script.
Gecko Driver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

2. Enter the link to your song (not playlist, must be direct link to the song itself) in the songs.csv
3. Start the python script
4. Enter the amount you wish to repeat the entire list ( a custom value can be entered, must be numerical)
5. Select Start and a Firefox browser will open and start playing the first song

   Note: This application listens to each song for 1 minute, then will move to the next song.

Please reach out and report any bugs that you encounter.
I have personally tested this and confirmed over 500+ views on 19 songs tested.
